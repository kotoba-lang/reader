(ns kotoba.reader
  "A small, purpose-built reader for the admission-gated `.kotoba` grammar
  (lists, vectors, maps, sets, keywords, symbols, integers, strings, and
  `#?(...)` reader-conditionals), used on BOTH runtimes.

  This exists because the reference reader was `clojure.tools.reader`, a
  JVM-only library, and the workspace therefore carried TWO readers for one
  grammar -- tools.reader on the JVM and this on ClojureScript. Two
  implementations of one decision is the shape where only one of them gets
  fixed. Promoted out of `kotoba-sema` so both runtimes read through the same
  code. Its nominal ClojureScript
  sibling (`cljs.tools.reader`, same Maven artifact) turned out to depend on
  several `cljs.core` internals (`cljs.core.ExceptionInfo` instance checks,
  `IPrintWithWriter`/`pr-writer` protocol dispatch, and a `:require-macros`
  cross-namespace macro) that nbb's SCI-based interpreter does not resolve --
  confirmed by spiking it directly (three distinct unresolved-symbol classes
  in as many fixes, not one isolated gap). Rather than keep chasing an
  open-ended compatibility surface against a general-purpose reader never
  designed for SCI, this reader covers exactly the grammar
  `kotoba.compiler.frontend/analyze` actually accepts (see its
  `forbidden-heads`/`reserved-function-names` and the total absence of `#{`
  or `#?` in every checked-in `examples/*.kotoba` fixture) plus `#?()`
  reader-conditionals and `#{}` sets for read-time parity with the JVM path
  (frontend still requests `:read-cond :allow` and a set literal must at
  least PARSE the same on both runtimes, even though `validate-expr` rejects
  a set value identically on both afterward).

  Integer literals are parsed as JS `bigint` (not `js/Number`), so a literal
  at the true i64 boundary (e.g. -9223372036854775808) round-trips exactly
  instead of losing precision the moment it's read -- required for
  `kotoba.kir`'s compile-time oracle (constant-folds a pure `main`
  by literally *executing* it) to match the JVM path's `Long` wraparound
  arithmetic bit-for-bit, not just within the JS safe-integer range."

;; `depth`/`max-depth` and `max-token-chars` mirror

;; (bracket depth and raw non-string token length) exactly -- both nil (the
;; default, via `read-forms`'s 1-arity) means unlimited, matching `.kotoba`
;; SOURCE parsing's current behavior on both runtimes (the JVM path's
;; `clojure.tools.reader` has no such limits either -- only bounded-edn's
;; various EDN side-channel files, via `read-file`, get them). `--policy`
;; is the one nbb-side caller (`kotoba.compiler.nbb.cli`) that passes real
;; limits, since it's the untrusted-ish EDN input bounded-edn was built to
;; harden on the JVM path. Both are checked DURING parsing, not in a
;; post-parse pass (unlike node-count/string-length, which
;; `kotoba.compiler.nbb.cli/validate-edn-shape!` checks after): unbounded
;; bracket nesting risks a real JS stack overflow, and `max-token-chars`
;; specifically must cover NUMBER tokens too (a huge digit run becomes a
;; `js/BigInt`, which has no `keyword?`/`symbol?` name to check length of
;; after the fact -- confirmed live: an earlier version of this file only
;; checked token length post-parse against `keyword?`/`symbol?` names,
